## Description ##

WordPress core does not use PHP sessions, but sometimes they are required by your use-case, a plugin or theme.

This plugin implements PHP's native session handlers, backed by the WordPress database. This allows plugins, themes, and custom code to safely use PHP `$_SESSION`s in a distributed environment where PHP's default tempfile storage just won't work.

Note that primary development is on GitHub if you would like to contribute:

https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-native-php-sessions

## Installation ##

1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it!

## Configuration ##

By default the session lifetime is set to 0, which is until the browser is closed.

To override this use the `pantheon_session_expiration` filter before the WordPress Native PHP Sessions plugin is loaded. For example a small Must-use plugin (a.k.a. mu-plugin) could contain:

    <?php
    function my_session_expiration_override() {
        return 60*60*4; // 4 hours
    }
    add_filter( 'pantheon_session_expiration', 'my_session_expiration_override' );

## CLI Commands ##

### `wp pantheon session add-index` ###

Added in 1.4.0. This command should be run if your installation of the plugin occurred before the addition of the primary ID key to the session table in version 1.2.2. You will be automatically notified when you visit any admin page if this is the case. If there's no message, your version is good to go. Note that this command is non-destructive, a new table will be created and the existing one preserved in a backup state until you have verified that the upgrade is functioning as expected.

### `wp pantheon session primary-key-finalize` ###

Added in 1.4.0. If you have run the `add-index` command and have verified that the new table is functioning correctly, running the `primary-key-finalize` command will perform a database cleanup and remove the backup table.

### `wp pantheon session primary-key-revert` ###

Added in 1.4.0. If you have run the `add-index` command and something unexpected has occurred, just run the `primary-key-revert` command and the backup table will immediately be returned to being the active table.  

### WordPress Multisite
As of 1.4.2 the `add-index`, `primary-key-add` and `primary-key-revert` commands are fully multisite compatible.

## Security Policy
### Reporting Security Bugs
Please report security bugs found in the Native PHP Sessions plugin's source code through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wp-native-php-sessions). The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment, and notify the developers of this plugin.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Why not use another session plugin? ###

This implements the built-in PHP session handling functions, rather than introducing anything custom. That way you can use built-in language functions like the `$_SESSION` superglobal and `session_start()` in your code. Everything else will "just work".

### Why store them in the database? ###

PHP's fallback default functionality is to allow sessions to be stored in a temporary file. This is what most code that invokes sessions uses by default, and in simple use-cases it works, which is why so many plugins do it.

However, if you intend to scale your application, local tempfiles are a dangerous choice. They are not shared between different instances of the application, producing erratic behavior that can be impossible to debug. By storing them in the database the state of the sessions is shared across all application instances.

## Troubleshooting ##

If you see an error like "Fatal error: session_start(): Failed to initialize storage module:" or "Warning: ini_set(): A session is active.", then you likely have a plugin that is starting a session before WP Native PHP Sessions is loading.

To fix, create a new file at `wp-content/mu-plugins/000-loader.php` and include the following:

    <?php
    require_once WP_PLUGIN_DIR . '/wp-native-php-sessions/pantheon-sessions.php';

This mu-plugin will load WP Native PHP Sessions before all other plugins, while letting you still use the WordPress plugin updater to keep the plugin up-to-date.

## Upgrade Notice ##

### 1.4.0 ###
Adds a WP-CLI command to add an index to the sessions table if one does not exist already. If you installed this plugin before version 1.2.2, you likely need to run this command. However, regardless of version at installation a notice will appear in your admin dashboard if your database table is missing the index. If no notice appears, no action is necessary.
