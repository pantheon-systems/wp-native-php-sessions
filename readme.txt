Use native PHP sessions and stay horizontally scalable. Better living through superior technology.

== Description ==

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pantheon-systems/wp-native-php-sessions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pantheon-systems/wp-native-php-sessions) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pantheon-systems/wp-native-php-sessions/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/pantheon-systems/wp-native-php-sessions/tree/master)

WordPress core does not use PHP sessions, but sometimes they are required by your use-case, a plugin or theme.

This plugin implements PHP's native session handlers, backed by the WordPress database. This allows plugins, themes, and custom code to safely use PHP `$_SESSION`s in a distributed environment where PHP's default tempfile storage just won't work.

Note that primary development is on GitHub if you would like to contribute:

https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-native-php-sessions

== Installation ==

1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it!

== Configuration ==

By default the session lifetime is set to 0, which is until the browser is closed.

To override this use the `pantheon_session_expiration` filter before the WordPress Native PHP Sessions plugin is loaded. For example a small Must-use plugin (a.k.a. mu-plugin) could contain:

    <?php
    function my_session_expiration_override() {
        return 60*60*4; // 4 hours
    }
    add_filter( 'pantheon_session_expiration', 'my_session_expiration_override' );

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why not use another session plugin? =

This implements the built-in PHP session handling functions, rather than introducing anything custom. That way you can use built-in language functions like the `$_SESSION` superglobal and `session_start()` in your code. Everything else will "just work".

= Why store them in the database? =

PHP's fallback default functionality is to allow sessions to be stored in a temporary file. This is what most code that invokes sessions uses by default, and in simple use-cases it works, which is why so many plugins do it.

However, if you intend to scale your application, local tempfiles are a dangerous choice. They are not shared between different instances of the application, producing erratic behavior that can be impossible to debug. By storing them in the database the state of the sessions is shared across all application instances.

== Troubleshooting ==

If you see an error like "Fatal error: session_start(): Failed to initialize storage module:" or "Warning: ini_set(): A session is active.", then you likely have a plugin that is starting a session before WP Native PHP Sessions is loading.

To fix, create a new file at `wp-content/mu-plugins/000-loader.php` and include the following:

    <?php
    require_once WP_PLUGIN_DIR . '/wp-native-php-sessions/pantheon-sessions.php';

This mu-plugin will load WP Native PHP Sessions before all other plugins, while letting you still use the WordPress plugin updater to keep the plugin up-to-date.
